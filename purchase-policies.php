<p><strong><a name="2" id="1">When will I be charged for my eBook purchase?</a></strong></p>
<p>When you enter your credit card information on our secure website and click download, we'll verify your card and check for sufficient funds. This process holds the cost of the eBook for approximately 24 hours and then releases that money back into your account.</p>
<p>After, the release of funds back to your account from the verification process, your card will only get charged 7 days after your eBook purchase because I want you to have plenty of time to review my eBook before you buy. </p>
<p>If you decide you want to cancel your purchase at anytime during the 7 days, reply to your eBook download email with, &quot;Cancel my eBook purchase&quot; or contact my support team on our <strong><u><a href="http://tamehisheart.com/contact-us.php">contact us page</a></u></strong> and let me know you want to cancel and you won&rsquo;t be charged. </p>

<p>Unless you requested a back-up disc(s) for one of my audio or video programs then you should be able to access all of my products instantly.</p>
<p>An email should have been sent to your inbox with login information for you to see my streaming videos and audio files online or to download my eBook.</p>

<p>I cannot police whether you share my eBook and videos with your friends. Yet, I do not recommend sharing your membership access code as only one person/computer can be logged in at any one time. </p>

<p><strong><a name="6" id="6">Is your eBook's 7 day risk free trial really free?</a></strong></p>
<p>I offer a 7 day risk free trial for my eBook to give you enough time to look through it and make sure it's for you before you spend money. </p>
<p>When you order my eBook, a &quot;verification transaction&quot; to test that your credit card or debit card is real and has funds will hit your account. This verification process holds the cost of the eBook for about 24 hours and releases the money back to your account.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll only be charged for my eBook 7 days after your purchase. You can cancel anytime during these 7 days and you won't be charged. Just reply to your eBook download email with, &quot;Cancel my eBook purchase.&quot; Or contact my support team on our contact us page and let me know you want to cancel. You can cancel with no questions asked.</p>

If you&rsquo;re not happy with any of my audio or video programs you can get all of your money back if you cancel during the 30 day trial period by contacting my support team through our contact us page.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m lucky to be surrounded by so many friends who are also dating and relationship experts, gurus, life coaches and great people. I created my Monthly Interview Series so that you could also share in their knowledge.</p>
<p>Training with many of these experts is not available to the general public. Others charge $500/hour for personal training sessions. To be able to access their treasure trove of wisdom is an amazing opportunity for you! </p>
