Whoever he is… he really does it for you! He makes you so nervous you can’t even bring yourself to tell him how you feel about him.</em></p>
                    <p><br />
                      He seems to you because when he sees you the two of you have great conversations. He gives you lots of dreamy eye contact. He always smiles when he sees you. He even seems to flirt with you and playfully touch your arm.  <br />
                      <br />
                      You always feel warm and tingly after talking to him any you know you&rsquo;d undeniably say, &ldquo;YES&rdquo; if he asked you out. <br />
