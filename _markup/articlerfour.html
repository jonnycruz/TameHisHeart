					<p class="excerpt"><img class="img-responsive" src="_img/FDP_romantic_nolove.jpg" alt="" />Everyone has heard this before in a relationship. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s me…&rdquo; the break-up line, still doesn&rsquo;t make you feel better about the break-up. <br /><br />
					  Maybe, because deep down you really do know it&rsquo;s you. You truly know that you did something (or didn&rsquo;t do something) to make this break-up happen. <br /><br />
					  That might hurt your feelings or be a hard truth to accept. But there&rsquo;s know saving your next relationship unless you can own up to this and start taking responsibility. <br /><br />
