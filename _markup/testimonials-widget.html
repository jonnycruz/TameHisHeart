		<h4>"I started dating again 6 months after my break-up...</h4>
		<p>...I was with my ex since college. Dating again was  completely awkward for me. My friends all had advice, like 'be yourself,' the sort of stuff that doesn’t really help. I read a few dating books and blogs, they all seem like they were written by my mom!</p>  
		<p>From the start your blog and e-book were different. I can tell there’s real dating experience in your philosophies. I’ve dated some since reading your book and recently found a man worth my love and time. Thank you OneTaste.."</p>

		<h4>"You're the friends I wish I had...</h4>
		<p>...because it’s so rare that actually get good advice from my girlfriends. Why do women have to always be out to get each other… even when they’re friends?</p>
		<p>After I met you I knew you really cared about helping me be happy in my lovelife. Every OneTaste expert I spoke with gave advice truly from their hearts. </p>
		<p>I feel hopeful again about relationships. My perspective has completely flipped. I know the power to be happy in love is in my control."</p>

		<h4>"I’ve got a master’s degree in Gender Studies and Psychology...</h4>
		<p>...I admit I learned more about realtionships from your e-book than my grad school textbooks. Thanks for standing up for women!</p>
		<p>Despite everything I know about relationships I started thinking I’d be happier alone. Your book gave me hope and power to say what’s on my mind to men. This is the sort of wisdom I’ll pass to my daughter (one day).</p>
		<p>I've already recommended your program and book to many of my girlfriends. And I hope you don’t mind that I teach a few workshops in the Vancouver area and show some of your DVDs."</p>
