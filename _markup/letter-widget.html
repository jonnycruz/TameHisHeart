	  <p>I’ve spent years struggling with dating, relationships and love. And I’ve watched my friends struggle too. </p>
		<p>I realized much of the pain was related to the fact that we didn't understand how to communicate with men, how their minds worked or even worse… how our subtle actions (we thought were meaningless) greatly affected their decisions.</p>
		<p>In fact, many women have been trying to meet their ideal man incorrectly. Even more so, many women approach trying to keep their ideal man incorrectly.</p>
		<p>I start with the fundamental belief that a woman’s sex is her power. And by harnessing this power any woman can design her own relationship and date on her own terms. </p>
		<p>I’ve helped thousands of women find and keep their ideal man… and I know I can help you.</p>
