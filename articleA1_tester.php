Have you ever noticed a man you're dating grow distant after an emotional conversation with you?</em></p>
	
					<p>Well, you might be shocked to know… his reactions to your emotions could have long-lasting damaging effects on your relationship. Plus, communicating emotionally may not be the best way to help him understand what you need from him.</p>

					<p>Society would have us believe that we are the exact same. While yes, we women can do anything a man can do (some things better) we must face the fact that we communicate differently.</p>

					<p>Studies show that men and women have different communication methods. 
Men are primarily "logical reactors." When you present them with a concern about your relationship they will attempt to solve the problem logically. They tend to turn off their emotions. </p>
					<p>Women are primarily "emotional reactors." When we feel something lacking in our relationships we need to share not only the problem, but also how we feel about the problem. 
Neither approach is wrong. They are part of who we are as people. Yet, the two communication styles can lead to misunderstanding, poor communication and break-ups. </p>

					<h2>Learn To Have a "Serious Talk" that Results in Him Understanding and Empathizing With You</h2>
                    
					<p>When it's time to have a "serious talk" with a man, perhaps about a relationship problem or maybe becoming a couple you must keep your emotions in check.  </p>
					<p>The point of communication is to come to an understanding. If you don't reach an understanding than communication has failed. And if communication fails too often then the relationship is a failure.     </p>
					<p>Be aware that your emotions left unchecked in a "serious talk" can ruin trying to explain to a man what you need from him. </p>
					<p>Think back to a "serious talk" with a man, when you unloaded your emotions. Was his response confusion or even anger? </p>
					<p>You see, before emotionally reacting about relationship issues men's brains move through a process of logically working out their feelings. If your emotions dominate the conversation he doesn't have a chance to logically process how he feels. </p>
					<p>Your emotional reactions cause his logic process to short-circuit. Instead of the empathy you were seeking you get anger and confusion from him.</p>
					<p>Accepting that a man needs time to process their emotions logically will help you help him understand what you need from him. </p>
					<p>As women we can never deny that we are deeply in touch with our emotions. Being sensitive and caring is what it means to be a woman. Still, it puts us at odds when communicating with men. </p>
					<p>The biggest challenge with our "emotional reactive" communication is that our feelings come out of us uncensored.</p>
					<p>Usually, before making a decision to have a "serious talk" with a man we often obsess about the issue. We think about it and discuss it with friends. We imagine the possible negative outcomes before they even happen. We work ourselves into a defensive emotional frenzy before we ever speak to him.</p>
					<p>We take weeks (sometimes months) obsessing about what we will say. Then when we finally have "the talk" we want him to just listen, understand and to make us feel better immediately! 
Then when we finally do have that "serious talk" with him we open up the emotional floodgates and pour it all down on him. And what really need from him is for him to listen and understand. </p>
					<p>But the male brain is a "logical reactor." As our emotions heighten in the discussion his logical brain is struggling to keep up and solve the problems one-by-one. Only after this "logical problem solving" phase will his brain move to emotional reactions and be able to empathize with you. </p>
					<p>If you pour out too many emotions at once, his brain is never able to get past the "logical problem solving" phase. And if too much is poured down on him at once he shuts down, or gets angry or confused and wants the discussion to end. </p>
					<p>Imagine the situation of "the serious talk" from the man's perspective for a moment:</p>
                    <uL>
                    	<li>When you tell him how you feel about your relationship this is likely the first time he's thought about the subject! He hasn't discussed it with friends or even thought about it before you brought it up. </li>
                    	<li>Your expectation is he'll hear you, understand and connect with you. All he hears are alarm bells for problems that he thinks he must fix right now.</li>

                    	<li>The way his mind works is he will first have a logical reaction before he can connect with you emotionally. He can't help it, that's just the way he is! </li>
					</uL>
					<p>I know that it's a challenge to keep your emotions in check during a "serious relationship talk." And you should never hide your emotions. Yet, you should let them out as slowly and smoothly as you can during the conversation. This allows him to move through the logical thinking he must process first. </p>

					<p>Most men are not good at ever discussing relationship issues. They avoid them because they know it's hard for them to convey their feelings with their logical brains. They instead repress them and hope they'll never need to worry about it. </p>

					<p>Show him that relationship communication can be effective. Show him that you're aware of your emotions and how they affect him. Show him you're willing to allow him time to explore his emotions in conversation. </p>

					<p>This will make him feel more comfortable discussing your feelings and his own. Before long you'll have a good system of communication established and a healthy relationship. </p>
