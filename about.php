					<p class="excerpt"><em>Hi, Joanna here.</em></p>
					
					<p>Allow me to introduce myself and answer a few questions you may have on your mind like…</p>
					
					<p>“Who is Joanna Van Vleck?”</p>

					<p>Or maybe, “How does she know secrets about the minds of men, dating and 
relationships that most women don’t know?”</p>
					<p>Raised in Texas, I've always been intrigued and inspired by male/female connections and social interaction.</p>
                    
					<p>I first stepped through OneTaste's doors from the land of internet business. After denying any need for the product of OM (yes, that went on for quite some time), I became an evangelist for sex as a practice. Where once her sex life was just fine thankyouverymuch, OneTaste taught her the A+ sex moves didn't equate to senstion.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>Joanna brings a background of psychology, product development and business development to the OneTaste team. When not OMing, Joanna can be found introducing OM to men in bars!</p>                    
                    

					<p>Now that my credentials are out of the way let me truly connect with you...  You see I have a belief that a woman’s sex is her power. And that power can be harnessed to design her interactions and her relationships with men however she chooses. </p>

					<h4>Why Should You Believe That I Can Help You?</h4>

					<p>I’ve studied human connection and social dynamics of male/female relationships my whole life… yet it was life experience that showed me the true light.</p>
					<p>I believe that ever woman deserves to feel loved and appreciated, be respected and desired, in a safe committed relationship with the man she finds to be her ideal partner.</p>
					<p>One of the greatest pearls of wisdom I've realized after talking to thousands of women (from around the world) in diverse situations and relationships is that many women have no idea how no clue how to act to make a man give them what they want in their relationships. Many women have no clue how to successfully communicate their desires to men or even sort out their own feelings about relationships.</p>
					<p>And, of course, popular culture movies, television shows, magazines (like Cosmo) aren’t much help either. These medias only display a candy-coated reality and give bite-sized dating advice that makes money and never really solves the problem (even making it worse on purpose in some cases).</p>
					<p>The real truth is that modern women as a culture have forgotten how to be strong women. Think about a strong female figure in your own life…</p>

					<p>A confident woman is universally attractive to all men. If you want a man to truly love you, it starts with truly loving yourself.  </p>
					<p>Women who have great relationships with men aren’t just lucky! They’re women who have strong, self-supportive beliefs like the following:</p>
					
					<p>For many of us we have to think all the way back to our grandmothers. What is it that female culture has lost that allows men to dictate are relationships statues to us?</p>
					<p>Still we see some women around us who seem to always be in charge of their love-life, whether it be in dating the men they find attractive, being in a committed relationship or even married. These women seemed to have an upper-hand and know secrets about being more confident in life than most women. </p>
					<p>I’ve made studying these types of women my life’s work. I’ve surrounded myself with strong, confident women who only and always choose to date on their own terms. And I’ve set how they approach relationships down into a formula.</p>
					<p>I believe any woman can read and follow the OneTaste, absorb the philosophies and secrets and design her own relationship, on her own terms with her ideal man.</p>
					<p>There is a way to be that strong woman who gets everything she wants in a relationship... and I have the proof, if you're willing to listen.</p>
					<p>I hope to talk with you again soon. For now, best of luck in love and life.</p>
