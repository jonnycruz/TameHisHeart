<p><strong><a name="1" id="1">How do I unsubscribe from your Tame His Heart and Turn Him ON email newsletters?</a></strong></p>
<p>I believe you'll enjoy the dating and relationship tips you learn from my newsletters. But whenever you choose to stop stop receiving them, there's an unsubscribe link at the bottom of every email newsletter you receive. Click it and you will be unsubscribed from my email newsletters. </p>

<p><strong><a name="2" id="2">How often will I receive your newsletters to my inbox?</a></strong></p>
<p>You'll receive a few newsletters per week, from me. Each one will be different and have helpful hints and tips for you about men, dating and relationships. Occasionally, I'll let you know when some of my programs go on sale. </p>
<p>Be sure to add my emails to your &quot;safe senders&quot; list. That way, you'll be sure to receive my messages to your inbox instead of them landing in your spam folder.</p>

<p><strong><a name="3" id="3">How will you use my personal information be used?</a></strong></p>
<p>I don't like spam either! I mean does anybody?</a></p>
<p>I only use the information you provide Tame His Heart and Turn Him On to send you my newsletters. </p>
<p>Don't worry about getting anything other than my newsletters. I won't sell or give your information to third parties.</p>

<p>I send out all my newsletters from joanna@tamehisheart.com, straight from me to your inbox.</p>

<p><strong><a name="5" id="5">Are your newsletters completely free?</a></strong></p>
<p>YES!</p>
<p>I want you to read my newsletters, use the tips I give you and see how valuable they are to your life. And if my newsletters inspire you to seek out more help from me then I hope that you will consider purchasing one of my programs. </p>
<p><strong>But you're never obligated to buy anything to receive my newsletters for free. </strong></p>
