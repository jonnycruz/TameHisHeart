          <p><b>1. "Where can I find a copy of my order email receipt?"</b></p>
          <p><b>ANSWER: </b>Your receipt was sent to the email address you supplied when you purchased your product. If you don't see your receipt in your inbox, please check your spam/junk folder. If you still can't find it then, please  <a href="/contact-us.php">contact my support team.</a></p>
          <p><b>2. "I'm having trouble downloading my purchases."</b></p>
          <p><b>ANSWER: </b>: If clicking on the link doesn't work, try "right clicking" on the link (with the right mouse button or right side of your trackpad).
