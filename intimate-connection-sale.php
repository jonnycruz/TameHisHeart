<p>Are you ready to STOP being used by men for just sex and eliminate all the
guess-work from wondering if a guy wants a commitment? </p>

<p>Ready to finally have the relationship you deserve with the man you desire? </p>

<p>Have you ever dated a man for a short while, then after sex for the first
time he disappeared?  </p>

<p>Maybe you thought he was into you, yet all he really wanted was your body. </p>

<p>Or have you dated a man casually for a while and you two are “sort of”
together? But, if you’re honest about it, your relationship is more like you’re
his “friend with benefits.” Maybe you have feelings for this guy, but he wants
to keep your relationship casual.  </p>

<p>If you nodded “yes” to any of my questions, you know the pain, rejection and
loneliness from a MAN USING YOU.   </p>

<p>And you’re not alone. I’ve helped hundreds of women fix this problem.  </p>

<p>The first step to getting a man to love you for you and not just for your
body is to understand his mind… </p>

<p>Men are biologically driven to go after sex even at the expense of a woman’s
emotions. The area of the male brain concerned with sex is 2.5 times larger than
in the female brain.  </p>

<p>This is why even early in the dating process you may find yourself imagining
what it would be like to live with him or marry him… meanwhile he isn’t even
considering those ideas.  </p>

<p>Most women know the pain of realizing a man is using them only for sex. It
hurts when you thought you had something special and then find out it was just
physical for him.  </p>

<p>Men do think about sex a lot. And their natural tendency is to want a partner
often. Still, if this were completely true than why would a man ever settle for
one woman? </p>

<h3>What Type Of Woman Can Make A Man Choose Her Over The Other Women He’s
Dating?  </h3>

<p>It’s useless to ask a man why he just uses some women for sex, but chooses
one woman to be his girlfriend. Even if you asked a man about it, he wouldn’t
have a real answer. He may say something like, “There’s just something about her
I didn’t feel from other women.”  </p>


<p>Well I’ll let you in on a BIG SECRET…  </p>


<p>A man doesn’t know what makes him choose to be monogamous! Several of my guy
friends, who were players, used to say, “I’ll never settle down!”  </p>


<p>But… the right woman comes along and BAM… they’re done being bachelors.  </p>
 

<p>The reality is, men don’t actively change their minds. They want to be single
until they meet a special woman who makes them feel something they’ve never felt
before… </p>


<h3>This Is Why He Really Won’t Commit To You </h3>


<p>Don’t feel ashamed if you are or have ever been a man’s “friend with
benefits.” It happens to many women </p>


<p>Still, I want you to consider why some women seem to draw a man in and make
him want to be monogamous and other women fail at it.  </p>

<p>Men are driven to want sex, but they can be satisfied with one woman. When a
man gets in a relationship it’s not because he wants to give up on being
bachelor. </p>

<p>It’s not because he’s finally worn out with the dating scene. </p>

<p>It’s not because he’s finally made a decision that he’s a one-woman guy. </p>

<p>It’s because the woman he decided to be with made him feel something stronger
than any other woman. She’s made him feel DEEP ATTRACTION. </p>

<p>A man can be sexually attracted to many women, this is what I call SHALLOW
ATTRACTION. And when a man just casually date a woman it means she hasn’t DEEPLY
ATTRACTED him. </p>

<p>Can you learn to make a man feel more than physical attraction for you? Can
you learn how to inspire DEEP ATTRACTION in a man? </p>

<p>Yes, you can learn to DEEPLY ATTRACT any man and it’s easy. </p>

<h3>Get Him To Beg You For A Commitment… </h3>

<p>When a man feels DEEPLY ATTRACTED to a woman he says things like, “I knew she
was the one.”  </p>

<p>Because DEEP ATTRACTION is something a man feels in his gut. It’s an
emotional response he can’t deny. It takes over his mind and makes him think of
you all the time. </p>

<p>This is the opposite of how SHALLOW ATTRACTION effects a man. SHALLOW
ATTRACTION is an impulse a man feels often, for many women. SHALLOW ATTRACTION
is guided by a man’s sex drive. It’s gone once a man’s sexual desires are
satisfied. </p>

<p>It’s easy to mistake a man’s SHALLOW ATTRACTION for DEEP ATTRACTION. And once
a woman realizes a man only has SHALLOW ATTRACTION for her she might try to
change his mind by clinging to him. </p>
 
<p>This is NOT how you turn SHALLOW ATTRACTION into DEEP ATTRACTION! </p>

<p>I’ll teach you all the secrets in my Keys to a Lasting Intimate Connection
about how to turn a man’s SHALLOW ATTRACTION into DEEP ATTRACTION.  </p>

<p>My Keys to a Lasting Intimate Connection program is designed to give you the
knowledge to create a powerful connection between you and the man you desire. My
program shows you how to make a man want to be with you because of who you are,
not what you look like. </p> 

<p>I’ll give you step-by-step instructions for inspiring DEEP ATTRACTION in any
man from the beginning of dating, all the way to relationship. </p>
 
<p>I’ll guide you step-by-step on how to DEEPLY ATTRACT any man for the long
term, whether you just met him , if you’re dating him already but stuck in the
causal phase, or evn if you want to fix a relationship with a former boyfriend. </p>

<p>You’ll learn 10 DIFFERENT ways to SPIKE a man’s attraction from SHALLOW to
DEEP ATTRACTION, including: when you should and should not bring up a
commitment, how to know if he wants more than a casual relationship… plus other
crucial topics to deepen his love. </p>

<p>I’ll show you how to pleasurably turn a man on further than just sex. And
after this, he won’t be able to get you off his mind. Plus, specific ways to
make him feel you’re “the one” he wants to spend the rest of his life with… </p>

<p>And much more… </p>
