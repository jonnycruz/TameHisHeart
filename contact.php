					<p><b>1. "Where can I find a copy of my order email receipt?"</b><br />

					ANSWER: your receipt was sent to the email address you supplied when you purchased your product. If you don't see your receipt in your inbox, please, check your spam/junk folder. If you still can't find it then please, contact my support team.</p>

					<p><b>2. "I'm having trouble downloading your ebook, Relationships By Design."</b><br />

ANSWER: if clicking on the link normally doesn't work, try "right clicking" on the link (with the right mouse button or right side of your mosuepad). When you right click the link successfully a set of menu options will appear. Choose "Save Target" or "Save Link As." Now select the place on your computer where you want to save the eBook. </p>

ANSWER: your unique access code is random numbers and letters, approximately 15 characters long and you can find it in your email order receipt. Your manual code should be in your download access box already when you first click through to download your eBook. If it isn't you can copy and paste it from your email into the box. </p>

					<p><b>4. "How long can I access my ebook?"</b><br />
